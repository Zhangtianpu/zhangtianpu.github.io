In the power grid equipment fault prediction project, I worked as a data analysis engineer responsible for data cleaning of oil chromatography data, including identifying anomalies and performing imputation for missing values.

In Fig. 1, I presented the system architecture of the project. The power grid equipment layer, as the data producer, includes devices such as transformers, power meters, chromatographs, cameras, etc., used to collect and monitor operational data of the power grid equipment. The second layer is the data cleaning layer, which performs data reconstruction and integration operations on diverse and complex data from different devices to ensure data quality and accuracy. To decouple the prediction system from power grid equipment and improve the practicality of the prediction system, the data cleaning module is completed by an external technology service platform. The third layer is the data service layer, responsible for synchronizing and storing services for long time-series data. The fourth layer is the fault prediction algorithm part, which utilizes missing data imputation algorithms and noise data processing algorithms to perform pre-processing and fault prediction services on the long time-series data generated by power grid equipment. Finally, the fifth layer is the platform application layer, providing users with graphically operable pages for data preprocessing and fault prediction operations.
